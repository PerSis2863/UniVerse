# Stage 5 handoff (for the next agent)

Read this first, then `STAGE-5-PLAN.md`: the plan has every item, and its **Progress** table says what's
done, where the code is and what's left for each item. Keep that table up to date as you go.

## Where things stand (9 Oct 2026)

- Everything up to here is **merged into `main`** (PR #47) and **live**. The owner checked that the
  production database has every migration up to **0081**.
- **Next migration number: `0082`.** Merging to `main` makes Cloudflare build and deploy, and the deploy
  applies new migrations first (`DEPLOY-CLOUDFLARE.md`, "Deploy command"). Nothing to run by hand.
- Tests: `npx vitest run` → **218 passing**. `pnpm typecheck` clean. `pnpm lint` 0 errors.

### Done in Stage 5

A1 lint debt · A2 design system · A3 motion/loading · A5 accessibility · A6 automated checks ·
A4 Web Vitals and bundle cuts (partly) · B2.1 course modules · B3.1 grading speed (partly) ·
B3.4 gradebook categories and final grades · B4.1 question bank · B4.3–4.4 shuffle and exam mode ·
B4.6 quiz item analysis · B15.3 report cards · B16.1 guardian (parent) accounts.

## What to do next, in order

The plan's order (section 2) is the guide. Suggested next steps:

1. **Finish block 4 (school admin and parents):**
   - B16.2 parent–teacher messaging (school rules: office hours, quiet hours, translation, moderation).
     Parent accounts can't use chat today: allow only what you build through the allowlist (see "Parent
     accounts" below).
   - B16.4 consent forms with e-signature, per child (school sends, parent signs in `/parent`).
   - B16.3 parent–teacher meetings (slot booking; the office-hours queue code can help).
   - B15.2 fees, B15.7 bulk CSV import/export with preview and undo, B15.1 admissions,
     B15.6 custom roles and permissions, B15.8 staff (leave, substitutions), B15.4 library, B15.5 registers.
   - B16.5 fee payment for parents comes with B15.2. Online payment needs the owner (Stripe exists;
     **UPI/Razorpay needs the owner's account**).
2. **Block 5:** D1 Learning DNA, D10 second chance, D2 Whisper TA.
3. **Block 6:** B7–B9 messaging, calls, docs and tasks power features. Then blocks 7–10.

### Leftovers inside finished items (pick up when nearby)

| Item | Not done yet |
|---|---|
| A4 | 3-size responsive images (store -sm/-md/-lg, change image tags), API caching / N+1 review |
| B2.1 | Drag-and-drop ordering, prerequisites other than a quiz score |
| B3.1 | Rubric level keys (1–5), inline annotation of PDFs/images |
| B3.4 | Per-school letter scales, mute/post grades, LTI AGS grade export, grade history audit |
| B4.1 | QTI/GIFT import, question types beyond multiple choice, random pools per quiz |
| B15.3 | Grading scheme presets (CBSE/ICSE/IB), school logo on the card, marks-entry grid |
| B16.1 | A demo parent account was **not** added on purpose: a shared demo parent that anyone can sign in to could be linked to a real child. If the owner wants one for demos, make it read-only (no linking) and seed a link to the demo student |

## The owner's standing rules (follow all of them)

- **Merge only when the owner says "merge".** Work on your branch, one commit per item, push at checkpoints.
- **No new emails.** Use `notify` / `notifyMany` with `email: false` (in-app and push only).
- **New features go inside existing menus as tabs** (`src/components/layout/SectionTabs.tsx`), not new
  sidebar entries.
- **Smooth motion:** `m as motion` from framer-motion with the presets in `src/lib/motion.ts`.
- **Links:** `@/components/ui/Link` (it never prefetches).
- **No polling** where live updates exist: `publish(userIds, { type: 'refresh', keys })` from
  `src/server/realtime.ts`.
- **Cloudflare Workers Free limits:**
  - At most 100 bound parameters per D1 query: chunk `in: [...]` lists by 90 and insert rows in small groups.
  - Live pushes are capped (`planLimits().livePushes`).
  - Long jobs run in batches the browser asks for one by one (see report cards).
- **AI** goes through `spendAi` / `featureOff` (`src/server/ai-budget.ts`).
- **Sample mode:** every new GET needs a stub in `src/lib/sample/router.ts` (and POSTs a `notice()` stub).
- **Request bodies** are untrusted: read them through `src/server/body.ts` (`oneOf`, `str`, `text`, …).
- **Never handle real secrets.** For local tests use throwaway values in environment variables, never
  `.dev.vars`.
- **No model names or IDs** in commits, PRs or code.
- **Anything that costs money needs the owner's yes.**
- **Don't import big generated JSON as a module.**
- If `CallRoom` changes, run `node scripts/test-call-room.mjs`.
- After a production build, revert `public/sw.js` and `public/fallback-*.js` (`git checkout` them).
- **Testing:**
  - `pnpm typecheck`, `npx eslint <changed files>`, `npx vitest run`, plus targeted API scripts and
    Playwright checks with axe at 390 px.
  - **No screenshots.**
- **Explain things to the owner simply**, step by step. They aren't a developer.

## How to run and test locally (from `apps/web`)

- **Prisma:**
  - After schema changes: `PRISMA_GENERATE_SKIP_AUTOINSTALL=1 npx prisma generate`, then restart the
    dev server.
  - **Don't run `prisma format`**: it reflows unrelated lines.
  - New tables need a hand-written `prisma/migrations/00NN_name.sql` (copy the style of 0080/0081).
  - Then run `pnpm -s db:migrate:local` and `node scripts/gen-owner-schema.mjs`.
- **Dev server:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_LOGIN=true pnpm dev -p 3100`.
- **Demo tokens for API tests:** header `Authorization: Bearer mock-token-<email>` with
  `demo@student.com`, `demo@teacher.com` or `demo@admin.com`.
- **Browser tests:** `scripts/browser-session.mjs` (`launch`, `signedIn(browser, base, email, viewport)`),
  axe from `axe-core/axe.min.js`.
  - `scripts/a11y.mjs` checks accessibility.
  - `scripts/crawl.mjs` visits every page.
  - `scripts/bundle-report.mjs` reports sizes after a build.
- **The demo admin is read-only for writes** (`demoWriteBlocked` in `src/server/auth.ts`). To test an
  admin POST locally, temporarily add the route to `DEMO_ADMIN_WRITABLE`, test, then **revert it**.
- **Parent accounts:** run the server with
  `DEMO_ACCOUNT_EMAILS=demo@student.com,demo@teacher.com,demo@admin.com,it-support@universe.com,test-parent@local.test`.
  Then insert a local user with role `GUARDIAN` and that email (`onboardedAt` set, status `ACTIVE`), and
  use `mock-token-test-parent@local.test`.
- **Guardian share links** (`/guardian/<token>`) need `SESSION_SECRET`: set a throwaway value in the
  environment when starting the dev server.
- Local test data: course CS101 has id `cmulde0g900147d341qn9mxlw`; the demo student is
  `cmulddzpr00007d342mkwhugy`.

## Things to know about the code

- **Parent accounts (role `GUARDIAN`):**
  - They reach **only** the paths in `GUARDIAN_ALLOWED` (`src/server/auth.ts`). It is enforced in
    `getSessionUser` and the core router.
  - Any new parent feature must add its API path there, and get a test in
    `src/server/guardian-accounts.test.ts`.
  - The dashboard layout gives parents a minimal frame and keeps them on `/parent`.
  - The child view is `src/server/guardian-view.ts` + `components/guardian/ChildView.tsx`, shared with the
    guardian link page.
- **Where people land after sign-in:** `homeFor()` in `src/lib/role-home.ts`. Use it, don't hard-code paths.
- **Error messages:** `errorMessage(err, fallback)` in `src/lib/api.ts` works with both `authedJson` and
  the axios-style client.
- **Report cards:** `src/lib/report-card.ts` (maths and printable page), `src/server/report-cards.ts`.
- **Gradebook maths:** `src/lib/gradebook.ts`.
